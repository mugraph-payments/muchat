# Muchat

Muchat (pronounced _"mew-chat"_) is the everything app, if it was open-source, private, fully encripted and under user control, not big companies with questionable data practices and shady goals.

In a nutshell, Muchat binds together the state of the art in secure, uncensorable communication, namely:

- [SimpleX Chat](https://simplex.chat) for end-to-end encrypted and private messaging,
- [Nostr](https://nostr.com) for micro-blogging,
- [Mugraph](https://mugraph.dev) for anonymous payments

It aims to be similar in spirit to [WeChat](https://wechat.com), but without everything bad it includes.

## Licensing

Muchat, as well as all projects under the `mugraph-payments` organization is dual-licensed under the [MIT](./LICENSE) and [Apache 2.0](./LICENSE-APACHE) licenses. Those two licences should be enough to cover most possible uses for this software. If neither of those is fit to your use-case, please do get in touch!
